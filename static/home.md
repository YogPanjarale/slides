## I got to know few things while learning this

- For math equations use [markdown-math](http://upyesp.org/posts/makrdown-vscode-math-notation/)
- For speaker notes using speaker view shortcut is `S` key
- For full screen mode use `F` key
- For overview mode use `Esc` or `O` key
- Notes can be used in markdown using `note:` keyword then the note will appear in speaker view

## Future Scope

- Try it with [Animotion](https://animotionjs.vercel.app/) and some animations
- Further can be used to make simple videos using screen recording and voice over
